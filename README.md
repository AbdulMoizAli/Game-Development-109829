## Game Ideas

# Muhammad Yousuf

I want to re-built the PAC MAN game with better graphics, the game is in 3d. Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde all got new avatars and they learn from Mr.Pac-Man moves and act accordingly to beat him. We also create our own avatar in the game for the character of Mr.Pac-Man.
