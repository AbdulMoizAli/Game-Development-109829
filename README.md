## Game Ideas

# Muhammad Yousuf

I want to re-build the Pac-Man game with better graphics, the game would be in 3d. Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde all got new avatars and they learn from Mr. Pac-Man's moves and act accordingly to beat him. Players would be able to create their own avatars for the character of Mr. Pac-Man.
